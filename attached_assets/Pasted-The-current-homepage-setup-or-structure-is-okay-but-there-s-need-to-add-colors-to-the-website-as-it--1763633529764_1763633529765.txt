Each tier should have specific permissions, visibility rules, and feature access.

⚙ Functional Requirements

Tier Assignment:
At registration, users select a subscription level (Basic, Standard, Premium).
Admin dashboard must allow manual tier changes.
Permissions Control:
Use role-based access control (RBAC).
Each tier maps to a role with defined permissions.
Listings Management:
Enforce listing limits per tier.
Premium = unlimited, Standard = 5, Basic = 1.
Search & Visibility:
Implement ranking logic: Premium > Standard > Basic.
Featured ads/promotions available only for Premium.
Chat & Communication:
Basic = text-only, limited messages.
Standard = full chat (files, images, docs).
Premium = full chat + deal management tools.
Analytics & Insights:
Standard = basic listing stats.
Premium = advanced dashboard (traffic, inquiries, conversion).
Payments & Transactions:
Premium users can transact fully on-platform.
Integrate Escrow, TT, LC payment methods.
Commission logic (1–5%) applied automatically.
Support:
Basic = FAQ/self-service only.
Standard = standard support.
Premium = dedicated relationship manager.
🛠 Tech Implementation Notes

Use Supabase/Postgres for tiered user roles & permissions.
Store tier in users.membership_tier column.
Middleware checks tier before allowing actions (e.g., posting listings, accessing analytics).
Admin dashboard: CRUD for membership tiers.
Future scalability: allow custom tiers (e.g., Enterprise).
