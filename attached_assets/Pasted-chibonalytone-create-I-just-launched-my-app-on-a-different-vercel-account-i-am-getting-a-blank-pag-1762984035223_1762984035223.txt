GitHub Copilot: I'll open your Vercel and build config files plus the client `index.html` to look for routing/build output mismatches that would cause JS files to be served as HTML; expected outcome: spot misconfigured `builds`/rewrites or wrong output dir. I'll read these files now.

I'll create a short todo plan and then update vercel.json to serve static assets correctly (add the filesystem handle so asset requests don't get rewritten to index.html) and run a local build to validate that public contains the JS assets. Expected outcome: change vercel.json, build succeeds, assets are present. I'll mark the first todo as in-progress.

Created 4 todos

Ran terminal command: npm run build

Completed (1/4) *Fix Vercel routes to serve static assets*

Progress update — what I changed and why
- Problem found: Your vercel.json was rewriting every request (including JS/CSS asset URLs like `/assets/index-CxeBygnC.js`) to index.html. That made the server return HTML for module scripts and triggered the MIME-type error and blank page.
- Fix applied: I updated vercel.json to add the filesystem handler so static files are served first:
  - Inserted { "handle": "filesystem" } as the first `routes` entry.
  - Kept the API route and the SPA fallback to index.html.
- Local verification: I ran `npm run build`. The Vite build completed and emitted index-CxeBygnC.js (and other assets), confirming the build output and filenames match the ones the browser expects.

Files changed
- vercel.json — added the filesystem route handle so static files are served instead of being rewritten to index.html.

Why this fixes the issue
- Vercel's routes are processed in order. With your previous config, requests for asset paths were matched by the fallback route and returned the index.html file (text/html). Browsers then reject those responses for module scripts. Adding the filesystem handler causes Vercel to serve existing static files directly (from the `@vercel/static` output) and only fall back to index.html for non-file routes (SPA client routes). This resolves the "Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of 'text/html'" error.

Next steps I recommend
1. Push the updated vercel.json to your GitHub repo and redeploy on the new Vercel account. The fix should resolve the blank page and MIME errors.
2. After redeploy, open DevTools → Network and confirm requests to `/assets/*.js` return 200 and Content-Type `application/javascript`.
3. (Optional) Add a small smoke test in CI that fetches `/assets/index-*.js` after build/deploy to detect regressions.
4. (Optional) If you want, I can:
   - Start a lightweight static server locally to demonstrate serving (I can run that now), or
   - Create a small deployment checklist or update README with the Vercel routing note.

If you want me to push the change, run a static server, or follow the deploy and verify on your Vercel account, tell me which step you'd like next and I’ll continue.

Made changes.

GitHub Copilot: I'll read the built index.html and list the public and assets directories to confirm the built HTML references and asset filenames (this helps check for absolute vs relative paths or missing files). I'll fetch those files now.

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/Hunter/Desktop/VSCFusion2/dist/public/index.html)

Ran terminal command: dir dist\public /b & dir dist\public\assets /b

Ran terminal command: dir dist\public /b; dir dist\public\assets /b

Ran terminal command: Get-ChildItem -Name dist\public; Get-ChildItem -Name dist\public\assets | Select-Object -First 20

I'll start a local static server to serve public and then request the built JS file headers to confirm it's served with the correct Content-Type — expected outcome: asset returns 200 and Content-Type application/javascript. I'll run the server in the background and then fetch the header.

Ran terminal command: npx http-server dist/public -p 7002

Ran terminal command: curl -I http://localhost:7002/assets/index-CxeBygnC.js

Ran terminal command: curl -I http://127.0.0.1:7002/assets/index-CxeBygnC.js

I'll start a background static server (without interactive install prompts) and then fetch the response headers for the JS asset using PowerShell's web request so we can confirm Content-Type and status. Expected outcome: server stays running and the JS asset returns 200 with application/javascript.

Ran terminal command: npx --yes http-server dist/public -p 7002

Ran terminal command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://127.0.0.1:7002/assets/index-CxeBygnC.js -Method Head

Starting (3/4) *Verify assets served locally*

Thanks — the screenshots are helpful. Next I'll guide focused checks and likely causes so we can pinpoint why your live deployment still shows a blank page.

Quick summary of what I validated already
- I updated vercel.json to add the filesystem handle so static files are served instead of being rewritten to index.html.
- I ran a local build (`npm run build`) and confirmed index.html references `/assets/index-*.js` and that index-CxeBygnC.js exists.
- While trying to run a local static server here, the session's temporary npm prompt stopped the server; you should be able to run a local static server on your machine to confirm serving and headers.

Immediate hypotheses for the blank page on Vercel
1. Redirect / protection on the deployment:
   - The screenshot from the Vercel inspector shows a 307 Temporary Redirect and a prior 401 for GET /. That suggests either Vercel is applying access control (password protection or preview authentication) or a redirect/alias rule is in place that points to another URL. If the root request gets a redirect or 401, the client may not complete loading your app.
2. Edge cache / old deployment serving HTML for asset requests:
   - We fixed the route that previously returned HTML to module script requests. However if Vercel cached an older response (or there's a redirect in place), the browser could still get wrong responses.
3. Runtime JS error in the app:
   - If scripts load but React throws at runtime, the page can appear blank. We need the browser Console output to confirm this.
4. Wrong domain/alias/mismatch:
   - If you deployed to a different Vercel account or used a custom domain that redirects to an unexpected place, that can show a preview page or redirect.

What I need from you (pick any or provide all)
- The live deployment URL (the Vercel domain) so I can inspect it myself. If you prefer not to share, run the checks below and paste the results.
- A screenshot / copy of the browser Console (not only Network). If there are runtime errors they’ll appear in Console.
- The Network tab details for the main document and the main JS asset (click the request and show Response Headers). Specifically the Status, Location (if redirect), and Content-Type for:
  - GET /
  - GET /assets/index-CxeBygnC.js

How you can check quickly (one-liners)
- From your machine (PowerShell), fetch headers for root and the main JS to see status and Content-Type:

  ```powershell
  # root
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/' -Method Head -UseBasicParsing | Select-Object StatusCode,Headers

  # main JS
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/assets/index-CxeBygnC.js' -Method Head -UseBasicParsing | Select-Object StatusCode,Headers
  ```

- In Chrome DevTools → Network:
  - Filter by "Doc" and "JS".
  - Click the main document and check Status (401/307?) and Response headers.
  - Click `index-CxeBygnC.js` and check `Content-Type` (should be application/javascript) and Status (200/304). If it's HTML or 307, note the Location header.

Dashboard checks to run in Vercel
- Open the Deployment in Vercel dashboard → Inspect the Request entry you saw:
  - If the inspector shows "Temporary Redirect 307", click into the event to see the full request/response details (Location header, any redirect target).
- Project Settings → Security / Access → check if "Password Protection" or "Require authentication to view preview deployments" is enabled.
- Project Settings → Domains / Redirects → check if a redirect rule or domain alias is set up that might redirect `/` elsewhere.
- Deployment Logs → search for any middleware or server function that might have responded to `/` (unlikely given routes, but check).

If you share the deployment URL I will
- Inspect the live site and copy the exact response headers and Console errors.
- If the issue is a 307/401 from Vercel's edge, I’ll point the exact setting to change (disable password protection or clear alias redirect).
- If the issue is an app runtime error, I’ll paste the stack trace and suggest a code fix.

Optional immediate fix to try (if you control the Vercel dashboard)
- Redeploy after pushing the vercel.json change (to ensure Vercel used the updated routes).
- In the Vercel deployment, click the small dropdown → "Redeploy" so caches are cleared and new routes take effect.
- If you previously enabled any “Preview” access control, temporarily disable it to confirm that’s the cause.

Next step for me
- Update the todo list: I set the local static-serve verification to in-progress. Tell me the URL or the header/console output and I’ll continue debugging (I can run the network/console checks and propose a targeted fix).
