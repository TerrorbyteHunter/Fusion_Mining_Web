Admin account 
User management, i need all three types of users to have their on tabs on the page
Buyer | Seller | Admins

Listings page, i need different type of listings to have their own tab, that way it is more organized if i have a lot of data  

The create listings function should be worked on so that it becomes functional and the admin can create a listing 

On the settings page, we need to populate admin roles with actual roles and capabilities for admins, i want to have 5 types of admins each with different roles, follow my below plan

role-based admin system with multiple admin types, each having specific permissions. Admins should be assigned roles at account creation or via Super Admin controls.
Admin Types and Suggested Roles:
1. 	Super Admin
• 	Purpose: Full control of the platform (founder-level).
• 	Permissions: Manage all users and admins, configure platform settings (commission, branding, maintenance mode), access all analytics, override verification decisions, CRUD on all content (CMS, listings, projects).
2. 	Verification Admin
• 	Purpose: Handle compliance and listing approvals.
• 	Permissions: Access verification queue, approve or reject marketplace listings, manage KYC/AML documents, flag suspicious accounts.
3. 	Content Admin
• 	Purpose: Manage platform content and branding.
• 	Permissions: CMS management (blog posts, videos, news), edit platform tagline, banners, onboarding messages, upload document templates (contracts, NDAs).
4. 	Support Admin
• 	Purpose: Handle user communication and issue resolution.
• 	Permissions: Access messaging system, respond to support tickets, reset user passwords, force logout suspicious accounts.
5. 	Analytics Admin
• 	Purpose: Monitor platform performance.
• 	Permissions: Access analytics dashboard, export reports, track listing performance, monitor fraud detection logs.
Requirements:
1. 	Admin Roles
• 	Define roles: super_admin, verification_admin, content_admin, support_admin, analytics_admin.
• 	Store role in admin_roles table or users.role column.
2. 	Permissions
• 	Map each role to permissions:
can_manage_users
can_manage_listings
can_manage_verification
can_manage_cms
can_manage_messages
can_view_analytics
can_manage_settings
• 	Super Admin = all permissions.
• 	Other roles = scoped permissions.
3. 	Admin Panel
• 	Add UI for Super Admin to:
Assign or change roles
View permissions per admin
Audit admin actions
4. 	Backend
• 	Middleware checks role before allowing access to routes.
• 	Example: /api/admin/verification-queue requires can_manage_verification.
• 	Store audit logs for all admin actions.
Tech Notes:
• 	Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) middleware in Express.
• 	Store roles and permissions in Postgres (admin_roles table).
• 	Expose API endpoints:
GET /api/admin/users/:id/permissions
PATCH /api/admin/users/:id/permissions
• 	Frontend: Show or hide admin panel tabs based on role.
